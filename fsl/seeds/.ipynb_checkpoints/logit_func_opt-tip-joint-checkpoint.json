          "algorithm": "The algorithm has two steps. First, select important feature channels according to a devised criterion. The criterion gives high scores for channels that minimize the inter-class similarity of the concatenated features of visual and category textual features, but maximize the variance of category textual features. Second, compute logits by combining the logits generated by CLIP's zero-shot classifier and the logits generated by a cache model. The first logits are computed by applying linear transformation to test features. The second logits are obtained by first computing the similarity matrix between test and train features and then multiplying the transformed similarity matrix to soft train label matrix. In each part, all feature channels instead of selected channels are used.",
